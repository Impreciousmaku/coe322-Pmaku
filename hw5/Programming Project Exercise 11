Write a program that tests this. You need at least one loop that
tests all primes r; for each r you then need to find the primes p, q
that are equidistant to it.
Use your prime generator. Do you use two generators for this, or is
one enough? Do you need three, for p, q,r?
For each r value, when the program finds the p, q values, print the
p, q,r triple and move on to the next r.
